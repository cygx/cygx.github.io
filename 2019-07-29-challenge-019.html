<h1>Perl Weekly Challenge 019</h1>

<p>A solution to the first task of the <a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-019/">19th Perl Weekly Challenge</a>.</p>

<h2>Challenge 019, Task #1</h2>

<h3>Five Weekends in a Month</h3>

<p>Write a script to display months from the year 1900 to 2019 where you find 5 weekends i.e. 5 Friday, 5 Saturday and 5 Sunday.</p>

<h3>My Code</h3>

<p>The most obvious way to do this I could think of, using the handy <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/routine/weekday-of-month">weekday-of-month</a> method:</p>

<pre><code>.say for (Date.new(1900, 1, 1) ... Date.new(2019, 12, 31))
    .rotor(3 => -2)
    .grep({ .head.day-of-week == 5 && .all ~~ *.weekday-of-month == 5 });</code></pre>

<h2>Update 2019-07-30</h2>

<h3>A Faster Solution</h3>

<p>There's of course a less involved way to find these months:</p>

<p>First, realize that in order to have 5 weekends in a month, that month needs to have a length of at least <em>(four weeks) + (3-day weekend) = (31 days)</em>. This is also the maximum number of days per month, which implies that any month with 5 weeekends in it has to start on a friday.</p>

<p>In code:</p>

<pre><code>.say for (Date.new(1900, 1, 1), *.later(:month) ... Date.new(2019, 12, 1))
    .grep({ .days-in-month == 31 && .day-of-week == 5 });</code></pre>

<p>This will run significantly faster as we only need to iterate through the months in a year instead of all its days as the prior solution did.</p>
