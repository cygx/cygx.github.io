<p>I always wonder what the Perl 5 people who are mad at Perl 6 for existing think being able to increase the major version number again would actually do: While I agree that Perl 6 didn't help the situation and might have made it worse when it took too long to arrive - and still cannot be used as a drop-in replacement for Perl 5 - the fact remains that its creation was a <em>reaction to</em> and not the <em>cause of</em> Perl 5's loss of mindshare.</p>

<p>I would argue that if you want to make Perl relevant again, you have to 'fix' the language first. Take a look at <a href="http://perl11.org/cperl/">Reini Urban's cperl</a> for what a more incremental improvement could look like. Only after that's done, worries about the implications of Perl 6's existence for marketing purposes become legitimate. That situation is indeed not ideal, but I suspect there are ways it could be made to work (personally, I think <em>perl2k 1.0</em> has a nice ring to it).</p>

<p>However, unless you also break backwards compatibility entirely to get rid of the biggest warts (e.g. sigil variance), the language might still be seen as outdated or cryptic; and if you do that, you're back again to something that's awfully close to the Perl 6 situation...</p>
