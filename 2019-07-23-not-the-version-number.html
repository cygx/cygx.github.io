<h1>I don't think it's the version number</h1>

<p>Some Perl 5 people are mad at Perl 6 for being called <em>'Perl 6'</em>. I always wonder what they think being able to increase the major version number again would actually do: While I agree that Perl 6 didn't help the situation and might have made it worse (it took its time to arrive, it cannot be used as a drop-in replacement for Perl 5, ...), the fact remains that its creation was a <em>reaction</em> to and not the <em>cause</em> of Perl 5's loss of mindshare.</p>

<p>I would argue that if you want to make Perl relevant again, there's no way around 'fixing' the language first. Perl 6 chose to do this no holds barred, setting everything on fire that was thought to be less than optimal. That's not the only way to do it, though: You can take a look at <a href="http://perl11.org/cperl/">Reini Urban's cperl</a> for what a more incremental approach looks like. Only after that's done, worries about the implications of Perl 6's existence for marketing that new and improved Perl 5 become legitimate. That is a problem, but I suspect there are ways it could be worked around (personally, I think <em>Perl2k 1.0</em> has a nice ring to it).</p>

<p>However, there's of course no guarantee this would work: If you do not break backwards compatibility entirely to get rid of the warts (e.g. sigil variance), the language will probably still be seen as outdated or cryptic; and if you do break compatibility, you're back again to something that's awfully close to the Perl 6 situation...</p>
