<h1>Revenge of the '90s</h1>

<pre>  <b>&lt;</b><i>tadzik</i><b>&gt;</b>    I wish people stopped using Medium :(
  <b>&lt;</b><i>timotimo</i><b>&gt;</b>  i'd love it if people brought back webrings with a vengeance</pre>

<p>Ask, and you shall receive: It's been a while since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring">webrings</a> have been a thing. The same has been said of Perl, so what could be more appropriate than a brand new <a href="https://6ring.github.io">Perl 6 Webring</a>?</p>

<p>Due to restrictions imposed by the same-origin policy, usability is sadly not quite as good as I'd have liked. It's still been a lot of fun to write, hence I won't be too sad even if people will not flock to it in droves.</p>
